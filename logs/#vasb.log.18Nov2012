[19:30:25] <mib_p5e8q0> :P
[19:30:34] <srossd> Yeah, thought so
[19:30:37] <srossd> I'll look it up

[19:31:39] <mib_p5e8q0> :D
[19:32:06] <mib_p5e8q0> dude
[19:32:12] <mib_p5e8q0> u should program it so that
[19:32:20] <mib_p5e8q0> if someone says brb
[19:32:22] <mib_p5e8q0> it pauses
[19:32:33] <srossd> I think I can do that
[19:32:37] <srossd> I'll look into it next weekend
[19:32:41] <srossd> Remind me
[19:32:42] <mib_p5e8q0> k
[19:32:44] <mib_p5e8q0> sure...

[19:34:21] <mib_p5e8q0> idk...
[19:34:37] <srossd> Once I fix the partyline this will be much easier
[19:35:22] <srossd> Aha
[19:36:10] <srossd> Cytosine;  Thymine
[19:36:14] <srossd> Ok
[19:36:16] <srossd> For lists of things
[19:36:26] <mib_p5e8q0> dude
[19:36:29] <srossd> Standard format is alphabetical, unless otherwise obvious

[19:39:45] <mib_p5e8q0> what?
[19:39:47] <srossd> I even looked it up in the file
[19:39:51] <srossd> But it won't take 5
[19:40:19] <mib_p5e8q0> idk...
[19:40:29] <srossd> I think I have to reload him
